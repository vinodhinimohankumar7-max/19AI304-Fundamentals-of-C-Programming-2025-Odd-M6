# Aim:
To develop a C program using the static storage class in a function with a parameter and without a return value to display the required output.
# Algorithm:
### Step 1:
  Start
### Step 2: 
  Include the standard input-output library: #include<stdio.h>.
### Step 3:
  a. Declare an integer variable `input` to store the user’s number.  
  b. Inside the function `display(int n)`, declare a static float variable `base` and initialize it to 100.25.
### Step 4:
  Read an integer from the user and store it in `input`.
### Step 5:
  Call the function `display(input)` five times.
### Step 6:
  Inside the `display` function, for each call:  
  a. Calculate the sum of `base` and `n`.  
  b. Display the value.  
  c. Increase the value of `base` by 100.25.
### Step 7:
  Repeat Step 6 for all function calls.
### Step 8:
  Stop

# Ex.No:27
  Implement a C program to perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on two integers using function pointers. The user should input two numbers and select the desired operation from a menu.
# Date : 
# Aim:
  To implement a C program that uses function pointers to perform arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) on two integers based on user choice.
# Algorithm:
### Step 1:
  Start
### Step 2: 
  Include the standard input-output library: #include<stdio.h>.
### Step 3:
  Declare four functions to perform arithmetic operations:  
  - `add(int a, int b)`  
  - `subtract(int a, int b)`  
  - `multiply(int a, int b)`  
  - `divide(int a, int b)`
### Step 4:
  Declare a function pointer `int (*operation)(int, int)` to point to any of the arithmetic functions.
### Step 5:
  Input two integers from the user (`num1` and `num2`).
### Step 6:
  Display a menu for the user to choose an operation:  
  - Add  
  - Subtract  
  - Multiply  
  - Divide
### Step 7:
  Read the user’s choice.
### Step 8:
  Use a switch statement to assign the function pointer `operation` to the appropriate function based on the user’s choice.  
  - **Step 8.1:** If the choice is 4 (divide), check if the second number is zero. If yes, display an error and terminate.  
  - **Step 8.2:** If the choice is invalid, display an error and terminate.
### Step 9:
  Call the function using the function pointer and store the result in a variable `result`.
### Step 10:
  Display the result.
### Step 11:
  Stop

  Develop a C program to store details of n employees (employee number, name, and salary) using structures, and display the employee(s) with the highest salary.
# Date : 
# Aim:
  To develop and implement a C program that uses a structure to store employee details (employee number, name, and salary) and determine the employee(s) with the highest salary.
# Algorithm:
### Step 1:
  Start
### Step 2: 
  Include the standard input-output library: #include<stdio.h>.
### Step 3:
  Define a structure `employee` with the following members:  
  - `eno` (employee number)  
  - `ename` (employee name)  
  - `salary` (employee salary)
### Step 4:
  Declare an array of structures to store details of multiple employees.
### Step 5:
  Input the number of employees, `n`.
### Step 6:
  For each employee (`i = 0` to `n-1`), do the following:  
  - **Step 6.1:** Input employee number.  
  - **Step 6.2:** Input employee name (allow spaces).  
  - **Step 6.3:** Input employee salary.  
  - **Step 6.4 (Optional):** Print the entered details for verification.
### Step 7:
  Initialize a variable `high` with the salary of the first employee.
### Step 8:
  For each employee (`i = 1` to `n-1`), do the following:  
  - **Step 8.1:** Compare employee salary with `high`.  
  - **Step 8.2:** If the salary is greater than `high`, update `high` with this salary.
### Step 9:
  Print the details of employee(s) whose salary matches `high`:  
  - **Step 9.1:** Loop through all employees.  
  - **Step 9.2:** If employee salary equals `high`, print employee number, name, and salary.
### Step 10:

  Create the C program to calculate the present age of a person by passing structure as a reference.
# Date : 
# Aim:
  To create a C program that uses a structure to store the current date and birth date, and to calculate the person’s present age in years, months, and days by passing the structure as a reference.
# Algorithm:
### Step 1:
  Start
### Step 2: 
  Include the standard input-output library: #include<stdio.h>.
### Step 3:
  Define a structure named `date` with members to store:  
  - Current date (`c_date`, `c_month`, `c_year`)  
  - Birth date (`b_date`, `b_month`, `b_year`)

  - b. If the birth date is greater than the current date:  
     - Add the number of days of the previous month to the current date.  
     - Decrease the current month by 1.  
  - c. If the birth month is greater than the current month:  
     - Decrease the current year by 1.  
     - Add 12 to the current month.  
  - d. Calculate the age in days, months, and years by subtracting the corresponding birth values from the current values.
### Step 7:
  Return the structure pointer containing the calculated age.
### Step 8:
